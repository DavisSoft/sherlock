Sherlock is a project to make a real AI bot

the objective would not be to play Jeopardy.  The objective is to make a program that can learn, and therefore teach itself.

I've worked on AI projects for 15 years, and I've done the neural network think and the natural language think.

This is something new. A new think.

So don't expect to find a lot here that you can steal.
